# Outstanding work

What the engine should do next, and why.
`docs/PLAN.md` holds the decisions and the history, `docs/OVERVIEW.md` the inventory and its "Not built yet" list; this file holds the work that has been found and not yet started.
An item leaves this file in the commit that finishes it, with its reasoning moved to the plan's progress log.

Written 2026-09-15 from an architecture review of `main` at `cf5f0a9`.
The review's standing verdict: the structure is right, and the debt is behaviour the engine ships as data and every game rewrites on top of it, which is the failure `docs/PLAN.md` section 1 was written against.

The order below is the recommended order.
The first section is what every game hits in its first week.

## 1. Own the loops the games keep rewriting

Nothing is left in this section; its three items and the swap below were built on 2026-09-16, and the plan's progress log says how.

## 2. Open the minds

The five items that opened this section were built in the six stages of `docs/design/minds.md` on 2026-09-16; what remains is the tactics they make room for.

- **Tactics that are missing, and weights that are fixed.**
  No pack or leader behaviour, no keep-at-range for a shooter, no patrol or idle routine, no noise or scent, though `DijkstraMap` is the right tool for the last two.
  `UseAbility` scores a footprint at two for a hit and three against for harm, hardcoded in `crates/rl-rules/src/ai/tactics.rs`; make the weights fields.

## 3. Make what exists real

- **Movement profiles that change costs.**
  `FlowFields::ensure` keys the cache by `MovementProfile` but builds every map with `PathRules::default()`, so a swimmer and a walker see the same map and the sailing profile the plan's river section promised is not wired.
  `TileProps` needs a per-profile walkability mask, and the flood needs to read it.
- **Anyone travels.**
  `WarpRequest` and `GoThrough` ignore everyone but the player (`crates/rl-bevy/src/places.rs`, `resolve_warps`).
  Companions, escorts and a monster fleeing down the stairs are out of reach until a non-player can change maps.
- **Attack cost, and a place for a miss.**
  `resolve_attacks` charges `BASE_ACTION_COST` for every blow.
  Weapon speed is the most common combat knob; put the cost on `MeleeAttack` and `RangedAttack`.
  Accuracy is deliberately absent (`docs/design/abilities.md`, "Accuracy does not exist"); the combat docs should say how a game adds a miss as a `DamageStage`, with an example.
- **`DamageStages` must not default to empty.**
  A game that forgets it gets raw damage and no word about why, which is the "a resource happens to exist" pattern the rules ban.
  Default to `SubtractArmor`, or declare it with `needs`.

## 4. Simplify

- **Split `crates/rl-bevy/src/ability.rs`.**
  At 1,562 lines it holds the state components, the effect registry, the gate, payment, `Offered`, the `Known` refresh, airborne landings and cue emission.
  State, registry and resolver submodules, and named `SystemParam`s in place of the four-tuple aliases `Spender` and `Bearing` that `gate` and `pay` destructure by position.
- **`TargetView` holds the enum it keeps reconstructing.**
  `ability`, `throwing` and `firing` are three fields for one sum type, and `Pointing::of` rebuilds it every frame (`crates/rl-ui/src/view/target.rs`).
  Store `Option<Pointing>`, and open `Pointing` so a game can aim something of its own through the shared cursor: a direction to dig, someone to talk to.
- **`OnMap` as a required component.**
  `on.map(|m| m.0).unwrap_or(MapId::SURFACE)` is written in turn, items, minds, places, status and both games, and tutorial step 1 has to explain why a delve's first floor is map one.
  Require `OnMap` on `Position` and the `Option` disappears everywhere.
- **Streams out of the prelude.**
  Corsair's loot drop rolls from `ResMut<CombatRng>` (`examples/corsair/src/items.rs`, `drop_loot`), which the randomness rule forbids; a game's draws come from `Seed::stream`.
  Remove `CombatRng` and `AbilityRng` from the preludes, and fix the drop.

## 5. Documentation

- **Guide chapters for the second half.**
  Lighting, stealth, abilities, statuses, saving and streaming each get one paragraph in `docs/guide/src/09-where-to-go-next.md`, and the alternative is the 1,280-line `examples/delve/src/main.rs`.
  Four chapters in the guide's style: lights out, being noticed, an ability in RON, saving the run.
- **A plugin table in the overview.**
  The rl-bevy section of `docs/OVERVIEW.md` is bullets of a hundred to two hundred words each.
  A table of plugin, what it needs, what it adds and what it emits serves a returning reader; the prose stays for the why.
- **One picture of the frame.**
  `EngineSet`, the `Turn` passes and their sets are described in prose in `crates/rl-bevy/src/plugin.rs`; a diagram on one page of the guide would replace what readers reverse-engineer today.
- **Doc comments at `turn.rs` density.**
  Many carry the history of how they came to be.
  That belongs in the plan's progress log; the comment says what and why-not.
- **A start helper.**
  A game begins with seven incantations: the plugin group, the seed, the tiles, their appearance, `WorldMap::new(tables)`, `PlaceRulesRes`, a warp, and then the state flip to `Playing`.
  One `start_in_place(player, map)` command could take the last two, and the tutorial's chapter 1 shrinks with it.
- **Split the delve's `main.rs`** into input, narration and content modules the way Corsair is, so the second worked example reads at the same grain as the first.

## Tracked elsewhere

- The plan's "Next" line: nights on Corsair's surface, scripted encounters, Bevy UI presenters over the panel views, and the living-world-rogue conversion.
- `docs/OVERVIEW.md`, "Not built yet": cursed items, heat and cold, liquids and wind, lit detection ranges, mouse-to-tile, instanced terminal rendering.
